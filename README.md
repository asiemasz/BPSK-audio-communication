# BPSK-audio-communication

This repository is a Simulink model of BPSK based communications system with audio signals.
It implements transmitter, receiver and also simulated transmission channel with multiple distortions possible in transmission over audio waves, analog microphone and loudspeaker.
A few recovery algorithms are included in receiver as well to provide koherent detection.
